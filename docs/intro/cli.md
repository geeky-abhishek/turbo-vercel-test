## Install Dependencies

Before proceeding, make sure your computer has [Node.js](../reference/glossary.md#node) installed. See [these instructions](environment.md) to set up an environment for Ionic.

Install the Dependencies CLI with npm:

```shell
installation command
```

If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

```shell
$ installation command


```
